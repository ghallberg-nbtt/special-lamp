This inexpensive yet powerful motor has 32 steps per motor revolution but is geared. The gear box has a reduction ratio of 64:1 and so increasing torque at the shaft. One revolution of the gear box shaft will need 64 rotations of the motor, so we set steps per revolution to 32x64 or 2048. Notice the breadboard PSU. This is needed as the Arduino cannot power the motor itself. The Arduino board is powered via the Vin pin.
