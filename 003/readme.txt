This project uses an Arduino Nano to drive an MAX7129 LED controller. The MAX7219 can control 64 LEDs. These can be arranged in the form of 8x 7-segmant displays. The decimal point adds an eighth LED to each segment. In this LM7219 device the LEDs are arranged in an 8 x 8 matrix. The project creates a dice and is rolled on a button press. There is an important learning message in that random number generation is not straightforward in the Arduino environment.
