This inexpensive yet powerful motor has 32 steps per motor revolution but is geared. The gear box has a reduction ratio of 64:1 and so increasing torque at the shaft. One revolution of the gear box shaft will need 64 rotations of the motor, so we set steps per revolution to 32x64 or 2048. Notice the breadboard PSU. This is needed as the Arduino cannot power the motor itself. The Arduino board is powered via the Vin pin.

Here we are controlling the motor in each direction using a 4-bit incremental rotary encoder. Checkout the action of the encoder’s switch. A rotary encoder, also called a shaft encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to analog or digital output signals. There are two main types of rotary encoder: absolute and incremental. The output of an absolute encoder indicates the current shaft position, making it an angle transducer. The output of an incremental encoder provides information about the motion of the shaft, which typically is processed elsewhere into information such as position, speed and distance. More about this rotary encoder in book 3 of Arduino Short Reads series –  Controlling Motors. Search ASIN: B08JS1584R on your local Amazon store.
